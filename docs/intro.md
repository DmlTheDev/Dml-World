## About the Website

I made this website using [Bootstrap 5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) along with the implementation of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) 

**Docusaurus** is a tool designed to make it easy for teams/developers to publish documentation websites without having to worry about the infrastructure. Docusaurus was first released to the public by the Facebook Open Source team in 2017.
